# CoreScripts

These are the scripts used to implement most of the essential server logic, including basic gameplay adjustments for multiplayer as well as state saving and loading.

Please note that the scripts for version 0.7 are completely unfinished and await additional streamlining of 0.7's scripting system. You should stick with the [latest 0.6 scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/CoreScripts/tree/0.6.2) for now.
